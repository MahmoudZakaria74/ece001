 <h2>Research objectives</h2>
<p>In this research we aim to study cryptography, its importance and use in practical and life matters and its relationship to computers.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cryptography, Practice of the enciphering and deciphering of messages in secret code in order to render them unintelligible to all but the intended receiver. Cryptography may also refer to the art of cryptanalysis, by which cryptographic codes are broken. Collectively, the science of secure and secret communications, involving both cryptography and cryptanalysis, is known as cryptology. The principles of cryptography are today applied to the encryption of fax, television, and computer network communications. In particular, the secure exchange of computer data is of great importance to banking, government, and commercial communications. See also data encryption.

 <h3>Cryptography<h3>
 <p> In short, it is to work for data security and privacy in the Internet, where when we send our data to another computer on the Internet, we will need to encrypt this data to ensure its safety and access as required.  Once we send data packets from voice calls, chatting, e-mail, or even using a credit card in the Internet, perhaps all of this data may be subject to eavesdropping or even theft, so we must use encryption while doing sensitive operations on the Internet.  Encryption involves converting data into parts so that it is impossible for any party to read these parts and understand any meaning of them.  When this data reaches its recipient, this data is changed to its original form and becomes understandable again.  This last process is called decoding.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>History of cryptography</h3>
 <p>The word "cryptography" is derived from the Greek kryptos, meaning hidden. The origin of cryptography is usually dated from about 2000 B.C., with the Egyptian practice of hieroglyphics. These consisted of complex pictograms, the full meaning of which was only known to an elite few. The first known use of a modern cipher was by Julius Caesar (100 B.C. to 44 B.C.), who did not trust his messengers when communicating with his governors and officers. For this reason, he created a system in which each character in his messages was replaced by a character three positions ahead of it in the Roman alphabet. In recent times, cryptography has turned into a battleground of some of the world's best mathematicians and computer scientists. The ability to securely store and transfer sensitive information has proved a critical factor in success in war and business. Because governments do not wish certain entities in and out of their countries to have access to ways to receive and send hidden information that may be a threat to national interests, cryptography has been subject to various restrictions in many countries, ranging from limitations of the usage and export of software to the public dissemination of mathematical concepts that could be used to develop cryptosystems. However, the internet has allowed the spread of powerful programs and, more importantly, the underlying techniques of cryptography, so that today many of the most advanced cryptosystems and ideas are now in the public domain.

 <h3>Cryptography techniques</h3>
 <p>Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as clear text) into cipher text (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption). Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.

 <h3>Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives</h3>
<p>•	Confidentiality: the information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended


•	Integrity: the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected

•	Non-repudiation: the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or her intentions in the creation or transmission of the information
•	Authentication: the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination of the information.,Procedures and protocols that meet some or all of the above criteria are known as cryptosystems. Cryptosystems are often thought to refer only to mathematical procedures and computer programs; however, they also include the regulation of human behavior, such as choosing hard-to-guess passwords, logging off unused systems, and not discussing sensitive procedures with outsiders.There are a lot of ways to use encryption, but for organizations concerned about data loss, two very important areas for understanding and encrypting disk are full and file-level encryption. Full disk encryption versus file level encryptionEncryption can be used in many different ways. The private employee accidentally says leaves a USB drive with valuable data on a train, or on the laptop gets stolen when left alone in a cafe while they go to the bathroom (happen).The physical kit can be replaced, but data on it can end up in the wrong hands and cause great harm - you may face financial penalties (depending on local laws and industry regulations).Or, customers may lose when they get a word that their personal data has been leaked.  It may well be legally binding to tell them.  Of course, from an ethical point of view, we always tell them the right thing to do, regardless of legitimacy. However, if your laptop or USB drive is strongly encrypted, the data is unreadable to someone without a key and you most likely won't have the 

legal issues to worry about. Laptops, USB disks, and even smartphones can be encrypted using what is known as full disk encryption.  This means that the entire hard disk of the device and everything is protected by encryption - from the operating system to program files all the way down to temporary files. Full disk encryption is also relatively simple to implement - laptops and smartphones now come with built-in capability, so-called native encryption.However, full disk encryption can only keep your stuff safe when it's in the device.  Anything second that leaves the device encrypted, is "magic" decoded and can be read by everyone.  This has important implications for your backup or files uploaded to the cloud service or attached to an email. If you think about this analogy of money in a safe place, the encrypted disk is safe, and the money is your data.  Once you take your money from safe it is no longer protected. On the contrary, if you have encryption at the file level, each file has a "lock".With file-level encryption, your data is protected while it is in transit, or stored somewhere in the cloud.But there is a downside - file level encryption is more difficult to manage than full disk encryption, because whenever you want to access data, you need a key.  As you have wanted to enter from many devices and many places, this requires careful management from the main.
</p>
<br>
<h3>When and how should you use encryption?</h3>
<p>Full disk encryption hardly affects system performance at all, but if you try to encrypt everything at the file level, it will quickly become uncontrollable. You need to think a little more about what data you want to encrypt and why.  You will likely want to focus on file-level encryption for sensitive data and / or data that you have copied to other places - for example, the documents you want to access on your phone as well as your desktop, or from services such as Dropbox. It is important to understand that file-level encryption does not replace full disk 

encryption.  They complement each other.  If you encrypt your files and not just the entire disk then it's very easy to miss something.  Chances are you have computer stores copying your data in all kinds of places that we didn't think about. Most companies will also want the IT department to carefully manage encryption keys via various means.  Without this centralized administration, data can easily be lost if a person leaves the company or loses their decryption password.  Unlike passwords used for access, passwords used for encryption cannot simply be reset by the system administrator if they are still forgotten. Smart company will make sure the master decryption keys are very well protected.  Even companies are smarter and ensure that no single person has full access to a powerful key.  One way to do this is to design a system such that two or more people need to contribute to the decryption process (separation of duties). Good encryption software will have capabilities to make key management and separation tasks relatively simple.

<h2>results and discussion</h2>
<p>1.	Authentication: When you stand on the doorsteps of the automatic teller machine and ask you to enter the password, you find one waiting to stick to your back and try to look at the screen, then you camouflage the movement of your fingers and pretend to press some buttons so that he does not know who looks at any number that has been pressed, it is practical  Simple encryption to protect the number that verifies your ownership of the account or card.
2.Privacy: It is okay to go back to previous times to talk about manual mail, when you were writing - if you attended this generation - one of the letters on a sheet, do not send it until you deposit it in an envelope.  This is for a simple reason, and that is your desire to protect the content of your message from being read from people to whom your message was not sent.  The reason is that you want to keep your privacy private, so you've encrypted your message.
3.Integrity: It is rumored that Al-Zeer Salem when he grew up and weakened by Abdan and wanted to kill him, so he wanted to recommend his sons to kill the two slaves after they killed him, and only the two slaves had before him to carry them the message.  Do you expect that the two slaves will go to his children to reach their last will?  of course no.  So, Minister Salem installed the two servants in one house to deliver it to his children, and it is [from the amount of the neighborhoods that they are awaited ~ God bless you and turn your father].  After killing him, they sadly returned to their village and informed the sons of Al-Zeer of his last home.  And for the knowledge of his sons with poetry, they knew that the two houses were incomplete, and they searched and found that their completion is [from the amount of the two lives that he was dead ~ He became dead in the prayer, praising, for God has turned you and turn your father ~ He does not leave until the slaves are killed] so they killed the servants to kill their father.  Thus, Minister Salem protected the integrity of his message by coding it in one house.
4.Accountability: When someone asks you to sign a check, your signature represents an encoding of your personality, since everyone has a way of writing that is almost completely different from others, and thus your responsibility for every check you sign is ensured.  This is one of the reasons why you should use encryption, otherwise you go one morning to find that your account is empty.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>We concluded from this research that encryption is a method that is the process of transferring data from its natural form to another form to be difficult to read by any party and preventing it from accessing the content of the data, so that the encrypted data does not seem important until it is deciphered by those who have the correct password or the decryption key  To make the data readable again.  And that the purpose of the encryption is to secure the important data for not stealing or consuming it without the knowledge of the owner of that information.
