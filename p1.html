<h2>introduction</h2>

In the world of computing, encryption is the conversion of data from a readable form to a coded form that can only be read or processed after decoded. Encryption is the basic building block of data security and is the simplest and most important way to ensure that computer system information is not stolen or read by someone who wants to use it for nefarious purposes. Individual users and large corporations use encryption, as it is widely used on the Internet to ensure the security of user information sent between the browser and the server.
This information may include anything from payment data to personal information.  Usually companies of all sizes use encryption to protect sensitive data on their servers and databases.
In addition to the clear benefit of protecting private information from theft or penetration, encryption also provides a means of proving that the information is original and comes from its original source.  Encryption can be used to verify the origin of a message and ensure that it was not modified during the transmission.
Businesses often don't realize why encryption is important, and how it can be used to protect their data. The more complicated the data encryption, the more difficult it is to steal it. This is why the programmer must encode the information well and carefully that there are no gaps.
